## üìå TL;DR
DeepShot is a machine learning-based NBA game predictor using advanced rolling stats (like EWMA) and real historical performance. It helps forecast matchups with visual insights and a clean interactive GUI.

---

## üí° Why DeepShot Stands Out
- Uses **Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA)** to capture recent form and momentum
- Visually highlights the **key statistical differences** between teams
- Clean, real-time **NiceGUI-powered web interface**
- Works **locally across platforms** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Based entirely on **free and public data**

---

## üîë Key Features
* **Data-Driven Predictions** ‚Äì Powered by real NBA stats from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com).
* **Real-Time Interface** ‚Äì Visualize upcoming matchups and model predictions with a sleek NiceGUI web frontend.
* **Weighted Stats Engine** ‚Äì Uses Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages ([EWMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWMA_chart)) to reflect recent performance trends.
* **Key Stat Highlighting** ‚Äì Automatically surfaces differences between teams to help you identify strengths and weaknesses fast.
* **Cross-Platform Support** ‚Äì Works smoothly on all major OSes.

cd deepshot
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Train model by running the notebook
# Open `model.ipynb` and run the cell to generate `deepshot.pkl`
python main.py  # Launches the NiceGUI web app
```
