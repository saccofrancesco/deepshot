    "#### Rolling Averages for Game Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we define a function to compute rolling averages for various game statistics over a specified number of past games (`game_window`). This is useful for tracking team performance trends over time while smoothing out short-term fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Methodology\n",
    "1. **Load the Data:** We read game logs from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "2. **Preprocess Data:**\n",
    "   - Convert the `date` column to a datetime format.\n",
    "   - Sort the dataset by `team` and `date` to ensure chronological order.\n",
    "3. **Calculate Rolling Averages:**\n",
    "   - Apply an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) with a defined `span` equal to `game_window`.\n",
    "   - Shift the rolling values by one game to ensure that each row only reflects past performance.\n",
    "   - Retain the first game's original values to avoid NaNs in the output.\n",
    "4. **Post-processing:**\n",
    "   - Round all numerical values to two decimal places for readability.\n",
    "   - Save the processed data to an output CSV file, overwriting any existing file if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that rolling averages are computed efficiently and can be easily used for further predictive modeling or analysis."
