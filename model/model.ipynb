    "#### Model Training and Evaluation Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will go through the entire process of training and evaluating a machine learning model for predicting NBA game outcomes. Below is an overview of the steps taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. **Removing Any Existing Model File**\n",
    "Before training a new model, we ensure that any previously saved model file (`deepshot.pkl`) is deleted to prevent conflicts when saving the updated version.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. **Loading the Dataset**\n",
    "We use `pandas` to load the dataset from a CSV file. A loading spinner is displayed using `rich` to provide visual feedback while the data is being read.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. **Preprocessing the Data**\n",
    "- We drop unnecessary columns, such as `home_team` and `away_team`, since they are not used as input features for training.\n",
    "- Any additional irrelevant statistical features (if specified) are also removed to optimize model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. **Defining Features and Target Variable**\n",
    "- The feature matrix `X` consists of all columns except the `winning_team` column.\n",
    "- The target variable `y` is set as `winning_team`, which is already encoded as `0` (home win) and `1` (away win).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. **Splitting the Dataset**\n",
    "The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio to evaluate model performance effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. **Training the Model**\n",
    "- A `XGBoostClassifier` is initialized with specific hyperparameters to improve model performance.\n",
    "- A progress spinner is displayed while the model is being trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7. **Evaluating the Model**\n",
    "- Predictions are made on the test set.\n",
    "- The model's accuracy is calculated and displayed using `rich` for better readability.\n",
    "- A classification report is printed to show precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 8. **Saving the Model**\n",
    "Finally, the trained model is saved as `deepshot.pkl` using `joblib` for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach ensures that the model is trained, evaluated, and saved efficiently, with informative feedback at each step.\n",
    "\n"
